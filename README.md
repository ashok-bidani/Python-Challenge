## Python Challenge
Completed four python challenges, each of which involved importing text or csv files and performing analysis on or transforming the file contents. These challenges helped gain familiarity with importing data in Python, using basic Python functions and methods, and utilizing iteration.

## PyBank
 - Uses mock bank revenue data (csv).
 - Perform analysis on total months, total revenue, and monthly changes in revenue and export this analysis to a text file.
 
## PyBoss
 - Uses mock employee data (csv).
 - Challenge is to convert data into a more readable format.

## PyParagraph
 - Uses text of any paragraph - in this case I used an excerpt of Martin Luther King's "I Have a Dream" speech (txt).
 - Perform analysis on word count, sentence count, average word length and average sentence length and export this analysis to a text file.
 
## PyPoll
 - Uses mock election data (csv).
 - Perform analysis listing the total number of votes cast, all of the candidates who received votes, the total percentage of votes and number of votes for each candidate, and the winning candidate and export this analysis to a text file.
