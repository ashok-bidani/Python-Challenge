I say to you today, my friends, though, even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. 
It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up, 
live out the true meaning of its creed: 
"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."
